# ü¶Å Leo

Leo is a handy little tool for finding your JIRA links. Very handy if you've got a lot of tickets but not a great memory. Luckily, Leo has a great memory.

You activate Leo like this:

`leo jira`

If it's your first time running Leo, you'll be asked for the first ticket. Leo isn't very useful until you add some links.

Once you have added some links, Leo will let you sort through them -- either by ticket number, or by a description, if you've added one.
This makes it super easy to find all your tickets without using the horrific wasteland that is JIRA! Of course, once you actually _use_ the link, you're on your own.

For now. ü¶Å

## Installation

- `yarn global @theosyslack/leo`
